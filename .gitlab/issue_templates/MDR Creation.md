### Design guidelines and instructions

#### Identify and reference detection logic prototypes

For each of following vetted source, search in their detection database if any detection rule is already drafted and documented.
If so, 
 - [ ] please add proper reference link into MDR file.
 - [ ] in MDR description, provide a summary of the detection logic used in the referenced link

#### Log collection
Please check log collections for intended detction logic(s) are:
- [ ] available; list them in MDR
- [ ] of good quality e.g. sourcetype in Splunk has been validated and key fields for search criteria properly extracted.
